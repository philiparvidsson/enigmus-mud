# Enigmus MUD

Enigmus is a simple MUD (multiplayer text game, kind of) game engine. As a kid, I used to play [Genesis MUD](https://www.genesismud.org/). Inspired by my memories of it, its awesomeness and an eagerness to learn the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, I decided to create Enigmus.

I've written a couple of quests to provide a testing environment (the HB quest tells the story of the University of Bor√•s!) and give examples of how the engine can be used. Notice the architecture of the engine - how extendable it is with scripts, how rooms are stored in texts etc.

The game is entirely in Swedish, although this is quest-dependent and, of course, quests could just as well be written in English or any other language!
